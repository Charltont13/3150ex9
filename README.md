# 3D Triangle Area Calculator

This project contains a C++ application that calculates the area of a triangle in 3D space using the coordinates of its vertices.

## Overview

The application uses a `Point3d` class to represent the vertices of the triangle in 3D space. It then calculates the distances between each pair of points and applies Heron's formula to determine the area of the triangle.

## Compilation and Usage

The project includes a Makefile for easy compilation. To compile the program, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:

```sh
mingw32-make
or make
```
